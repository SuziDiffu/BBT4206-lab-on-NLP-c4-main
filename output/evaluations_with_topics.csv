Data Visualization and Storytelling Tools – Hands-on training with tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker to help students communicate insights effectively.

Big Data Analytics – Understanding how to process and analyze large-scale datasets using modern platforms like Hadoop or Spark.

Machine Learning for Business Insights – Introducing predictive analytics, classification models, and AI integration for real-world business forecasting.
